This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles string concatenation with the `.` operator and the implicit type coercion that occurs when concatenating strings with numbers.  When the `$total` variable is calculated, it's an integer. When you concatenate it with the string '"USD"', PHP implicitly converts the integer to a string. However, this can lead to unexpected results if `$total` is a very large number exceeding PHP's integer limits. In such cases, the integer might overflow, and the resulting string representation could be inaccurate or unexpected.

```php
<?php
$price = 2147483647; // Maximum 32-bit signed integer
$quantity = 2;
$total = $price * $quantity; // Integer overflow might occur here
echo "Total cost: " . $total . "USD";
?>
```
